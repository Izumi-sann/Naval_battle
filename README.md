started on 6-12-2024

## 🏴‍☠️ Ahoy, Mateys!
Welcome aboard the **Naval Battle** game! This be a swashbucklin' adventure coded with Window Forms in the finest C#. Set sail and engage epic naval battles in the high seas!

## features
place ships, move those ships, enter in battle with the computer bot created by mineself ...
and plenty more functions only wait to be discovered by ya

**update 30-12-24:**
- you can now decide the number of ships you get to place in the current game within the reset setting; 

- the computer now doesn't follow a predefined attack pattern and can start the attack of a ship in any direction, this mechanic will be further improved with more casuality
in the past the attack pattern was (right -> left -> bottom -> top) of a given ship_tile, now is more random.

## before you start
the core mechanics are working properly, with 2 bugs i'll eventually solve in the future, 
just don't click X when resetting the table if you don't wan't the program to crash cause i was too tired to add a try - catch block

and what's more? 
### have fun
